# Hi 👋, I'm Angel Vazquez
### Full Stack Developer | AWS Cloud & Serverless Specialist

<br>

I'm a Full Stack Developer focused on transforming business requirements into high-impact, scalable solutions. As a specialist in serverless architectures with **AWS** and **Terraform**, I enjoy building robust systems from the ground up.

My experience includes engineering a public-facing **Next.js** solution for over 10,000 users by implementing an on-demand page generation system in AWS to bypass build-time limitations.
